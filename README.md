# Graph

## Task
The task is to implement **Graph** data structure and basic algorithms. 

## Modifiers
**add_edge** take two vertexes and create an edge with the given weight-value.  
**delete_edge** take two vertexes and delete and edge between them.  

## Based on
The data organization type of data structure **Graph** is an adjacency matrix.  
The basic value of this matrix is the weight of the vertex in graph.  
I encapsulated the analog of the vector into SortedSequence that I had already developed([Sequence](https://github.com/VanyushaDoronin/Sequence)).
